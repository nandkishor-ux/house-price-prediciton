## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a complete ML pipeline to estimate house prices based on property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, and amenities. The final trained model is exported as a `.pkl` file for deployment.

---

## 🔬 What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned the **Housing dataset** with feature engineering
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — correlation analysis, distribution plots
- Encoded categorical variables (furnishing status, main road access, etc.)
- Trained and evaluated multiple regression models
- Exported the best model as **`final_house_price_model.pkl`** using Joblib

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nandkishor-ux/house-price-prediciton.git
cd house-price-prediciton

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter joblib

# 3. Open the notebook
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction_1.ipynb
```

### To use the saved model directly:

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

model = joblib.load('final_house_price_model.pkl')

# Example prediction
sample = pd.DataFrame([{
    'area': 7420, 'bedrooms': 4, 'bathrooms': 2,
    'stories': 3, 'mainroad': 1, 'guestroom': 0,
    'basement': 0, 'hotwaterheating': 0, 'airconditioning': 1,
    'parking': 2, 'prefarea': 1, 'furnishingstatus': 1
}])

predicted_price = model.predict(sample)
print(f"Estimated Price: ₹{predicted_price[0]:,.0f}")
```
